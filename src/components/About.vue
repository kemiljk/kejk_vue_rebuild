          I started out my career with a deep love of psychology and a Masters in Fine Art creating behaviour-influencing sculptures and digital installations.
          Now, having spent 6 years bringing design thinking practices to rare diseases, I lead a design team delivering elegant human-centric solutions to change the face of renewable energy.
