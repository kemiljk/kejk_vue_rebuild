I left University with a Masters in Fine Art but didn’t feel I was worthy of a design or development role (despite developing skills in both places for around 10 years prior) so I went from my full-time retail job at Apple to working as an Account Executive in pharmaceutical advertising.

I expanded skills learnt from Apple Retail about how to explain the complex in a simple way, breaking technology down to its simplest form and developing similes and metaphors for different approaches. All of this led to accurate communication and valuable insight into the customer experience.")]),o("p",[e._v("So, fast forward to now. Now I design and develop the frontend experience of products.

Why it can’t be exactly like that thing they showed me that one time that kind of did the same thing. Why it’s going to take six months to develop that special graph that takes data from 56 sources, runs a machine learning algorithm to extract the most valuable insights, feeds it back into the UI and generates a personalised graph in real-time with up-to-the-second data.")]),o("p",[e._v("But I also go to those meetings, sit in on those calls, talk to those potential customers and explain these things myself.
