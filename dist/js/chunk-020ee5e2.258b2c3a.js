Really, it was birthed in Silicon Valley as a way of thinking about the end person using your product and avoid a narrow focus on delivering a solution that you (as in the company) think is the right thing. The problem with a user focus is that it’s easy to abstract the term user into being a statistic. A user is a term we attribute onto a person that uses our product, but it is far too easy for that to become a percentage on a spreadsheet or a cumulative number that appears on an analytics report. Treating the people we affect most as users can have a negative effect on how we think about our products and lead us to believe that our focus is on increasing that percentage or building up those numbers, only.")]),a("p",[t._v("Human-centered design is a term that's been explored and advocated for by many established designers from David and Tom Kelley, to Donald Norman and even into architecture by way of Mike Cooley.")]),a("p",[t._v("My argument is for a permanant change, a move away from user-centricity and user experience and towards human-centricity and human-experience.
